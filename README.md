# VUTTR App

I'm busy man, I dit not finish all layout but the app is functional.

## Run

Instructions:

Make sure the back-end is running and then:

`sh yarn run start `

You may need to run the app in another port, because the back-end is using the port 3000.

## TODO

- Finish design system
- Remove inline CSS
- Create a component for the tags
- Tests
